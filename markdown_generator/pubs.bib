        abstract = {Abundant studies have shown that visualization is advantageous for software developers, yet adopting visualization during software development is not a common practice due to the large effort involved in finding an appropriate visualization. Developers require support to facilitate that task. Among 368 papers in SOFTVIS/VISSOFT venues, we identify 86 design study papers about the application of visualization to relieve concerns in software development. We extract from these studies the task, need, audience, data source, representation, medium and tool; and we characterize them according to the subject, process and problem domain. On the one hand, we support software developers to put visualization in action by mapping existing visualization techniques to particular needs from different perspectives. On the other hand, we highlight the problem domains that are overlooked in the field and need more support.}}

        abstract = {Abstract Context: Software visualizations can help
                developers to analyze multiple aspects of complex software systems, but
                their effectiveness is often uncertain due to the lack of evaluation
                guidelines. Objective: We identify common problems in the evaluation of
                software visualizations with the goal of formulating guidelines to
                improve future evaluations. Method: We review the complete literature
                body of 387 full papers published in the SOFTVIS/VISSOFT conferences, and
                study 181 of those from which we could extract evaluation strategies,
                data collection methods, and other aspects of the evaluation. Results: Of
                the proposed software visualization approaches, 62% lack a strong
                evaluation. We argue that an effective software visualization should not
                only boost time and correctness but also recollection, usability,
                engagement, and other emotions. Conclusion: We call on researchers
                proposing new software visualizations to provide evidence of their
                effectiveness by conducting thorough (i) case studies for approaches that
                must be studied in situ, and when variables can be controlled, (ii)
                experiments with randomly selected participants of the target audience
                and real-world open source software systems to promote reproducibility
                and replicability. We present guidelines to increase the evidence of the
                effectiveness of software visualization approaches, thus improving their
                adoption rate.}}
